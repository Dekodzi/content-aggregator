# Content Aggregator

This simple application lists some news from websites about coffee.

## Requirements

1. Python 3.10.x
2. Flask
3. Beautifulsoup4
4. Requests

## Usage

### Initialize a virtual environment
```bash
py -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate.bat
```

### Install the dependencies

```bash
pip install flask
pip install bs4
pip install requests
```

### Initialize a local server

```bash
py -m flask --app app run 
```
Open it with your web browser typing localhost:5000

## Purpose

I made this application to learn basics of Flask and recall some HTML and CSS knowledge. It isn't beautiful or well written, but it works. In the future I plan to make it responsive and put it on some hosting line PythonAnywhere. For now it's just for learning purposes.
